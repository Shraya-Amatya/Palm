# Land Selling Website Project

## About the Project

This project was created as a learning experience before I became more familiar with proper Git practices, which is why there are no commits recorded in this repository. At the time, I was not in the habit of committing regularly.

### Project Overview
The goal of this project was to create a land-selling website. Here are the key features I worked on:

1. **Homepage**: Designed and developed the homepage with the help of different seniors.
2. **Backend**:
   - Built using **Node.js**.
   - Used **Postman** for API testing and to handle functionalities like:
     - Adding details such as land size, photo, drainage (yes/no), quality, and location.
3. **Authentication**:
   - Developed a **login** and **register** page.
   - Registration stores data locally using **MySQL** and **XAMPP**.
   - Implemented a **forgot password** feature that:
     - Checks if the email exists in the database.
     - Sends a password reset link to the provided email.
   - Integrated **OAuth login** with Google.

### Note
Since this project was created before I learned Git practices, the entire development was done without regular commits, and the repository contains the completed project files.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: React,Css
- **Backend**: Node.js
- **Database**: MySQL (with XAMPP)
- **API Testing**: Postman

## Lessons Learned
This project taught me valuable skills in:
- Backend development with Node.js
- Database integration with MySQL
- Building authentication systems, including OAuth and email-based password recovery
- Collaborating with seniors for UI/UX design

I also learned the importance of version control, and since then, I have started using Git properly for all my projects.
